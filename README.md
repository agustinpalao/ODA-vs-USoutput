### Official Development Assistance, what is in it for Donor Countries?
**Description:** There is an emergent trend in development aid towards the historical way of providing assistance to developing nations. Some call this _The south-south cooperation,_ where donorship is performed by other developing countries or even emerging economic powers such as China with heavy interests in development projects. 
I aim to produce a model that explains the responses of traditional donors, such as OECD's members with respect to this new inflows of development aid. 

**Related questions:** 
  * Should the U.S. keep proividing the same level of aid to developing countries that are currently receiving aid from China?
  * The U.S. bilateral relationships such as trade balance will be affected due to these new aid inflows?
  * To what development areas an OECD country should invest to maximize benefits?
  
 **Proposed project outline:**
 * Data wrangling:
   * description of Official Development Assistance data
   * data cleaning and preliminar descriptive analyisis
 * Data visualization:
   * ODA time series per country 
   * ODA time series per industry
 * Inferential statistics:
   * Hypothesis testing, correlations & ANOVA tests
 * Model development and ML proposal:
