### Official Development Assistance, what is in it for Donor Countries?
**Description:** There is an emergent trend in development aid towards the historical way of providing assistance to developing nations. Some call this _The south-south cooperation,_ where donorship is performed by other developing countries or even emerging economic powers such as China with heavy interests in development projects. 
The historic motivations of donor countries for doing financial assistanship in developing countries are strongly related to commercial, security and development purposes. I aim to produce a model that identifies types of interest in bilateral donorships, and if such relationships have changed through time.

%%explains the responses of traditional donors, such as OECD's members with respect to this new inflows of development aid.

  * Should the U.S. keep proividing the same level of aid to developing countries that are currently receiving aid from China?
  * The U.S. bilateral relationships such as trade balance will be affected due to these new aid inflows?
  * To what development areas an OECD country should invest to maximize benefits?
